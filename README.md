# gfx
stb style header-only raster graphics

---
### Usage/API
just include [gfx.h](./gfx.h?raw=1) in your code, the file also contains documentation on how to use the library.

you need define `INCLUDE_GFX_IMPLEMENTATION` only once in any file before including the header so that function implementations get compiled too.
